Analysis of an electromagnetic attack
=====================================

I noticed the attack voice-to-skull the last year, July 15th 2017.

The artificial deficiency coordinates the sequences and the psychology
of the dialogues, often offensive, and the interferences to the normal
neural oscillations that disturb the sleep with tremors, convulsions, etc.

The following video shows a part of the signal directed to my head:

In Italy "The personal freedom is inviolable." [1]

My head is continually tracked, probably using the technology of the
deficient missiles.

The criminals use the radio without limits of frequency, disturbing
also the musical transmissions in FM.

There are at least four fixed positions of the attackers. The measures
have been taken in Rome (north), June 5th 2018, by using SDR, a simple
antenna and a digital compass.

-   NNE 20°
-   NNW 338°
-   between SW 227° and WSW 251°
-   between E 92° and SE 127°

I want to share the analysis of this attack to break the veil of
mystery, often ignorantly divulged by using the word "conspiracy".

I have analyzed the complete dynamics of the attack. This document
contains what I can unequivocally explain (15% of the overall attack
but I will write other and I will improve the structure of this
document). I am a simple musician and programmer.

The decoding is improvable (I have used a simple slope detector), but
if you hear a voice in the audio file

also the [US embassy in Cuba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embassy_attack_accusations_in_Cuba)
unconsciously suffered a similar offensive action, because what you
have just listened is hidden in a published recording [2]. Perhaps the
used signal was rectified by an anomalous Hall effect in some
ferromagnetic material [3]. Therefore the embassy workers have
accidentally listened to the result of an envelope follower.

The sonogram of a recording of the signal, with central frequency of
945 MHz and sampling rate of 2 MHz, highlights the main pulses:

![](media/sonogram_945mhz.jpg)

During the recording, the infamous criminals lower the level of the
voices and increase the noise. Recently, the level of the voices is
also very low if I don't record, however the intensity of the
induced [tinnitus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinnitus) is
unchanged.

A pulse "A" is the sum of 100 sinusoids separated by 1733 Hz, so the
bandwidth is 173.3 kHz.

A pulse "B" is the sum of 7 sinusoids separated by 216.6 Hz (= 1733/8).
The pattern of the the pulse repetition periods is

```
A A A A B A A A A B A A A A B ...

A = 0.0461 s = 80 / 1733  => 21.69 Hz
B = 0.0511 s = 75 / 1469  => 19.57 Hz
freq_average = 5 / ((A * 4) + B) = 21.23 Hz
```

That signal is very important. I have an idea but I still have to
develop it, therefore I avoid superficial comments. However, it is
possible to compute the induced pressure amplitude by using the
formula and the amplitude factors of the figure 4 in [4]:

```
P(pulse_width) = A*abs(sin(pi*freq*pulse_width)) =

= 572*abs(sin(pi*7800/(216.625*7))) = 2.49e-4 Pa (about 22 dB SPL)
```

where 7800 Hz is the main acoustic frequency.

The part labeled "misc" contains pulses produced by the sum of
sinusoids separated by 1469 Hz and other sinusoids also separated by
1469 Hz.

Voice encoding
--------------

The criminals use more techniques.

A simple recipe to get the pulses A is the following:

-   Sinusoidal signal with frequency 14.5 kHz, frequency modulated by a vocal sound.

-   Pulse generated each time the amplitude of the modulated signal goes from positive to negative.

The pulses are generated by the sum of sinusoids separated by the
frequencies that cause an unceasing resonant tinnitus in my head.

Any time a RF pulse is absorbed by the cerebral tissue, the
temperature rises of 5e-6 °C [5]. The rapid thermal expansion produces
a thermoelastic wave that travels to the inner ear. Therefore the
criminals use that thermo-acoustic demodulator to send vocal messages
to me through ultrasounds.

This information defuses the psychologic weapon because it cancels the
suggestive effect. The childish effect "play the entryphone and run
away" persists.

Hypothesis about the US embassy attack in Cuba
----------------------------------------------

The recording of what some US embassy workers heard in Havana has
characteristics similar to the signal at 945MHz that I receive in my
head. The main difference is the distance in frequency between the
sinusoids that generate the pulses. In my case:

-   Pulses with sinusoids separated by 216.6 Hz and pulse repetition periods with A-A-A-A-B (see above).

-   Pulses with sinusoids separated by 1733 Hz and variable pulse repetition period.

In the Cuban case, the sinusoids are always separated by 180 Hz but
the 21 Hz clock is the same.

The amplitudes of the following sonogram are in dB to highlight the
part filtered by the recorder or by the editor:

![](media/cuba_clock.jpg)

Instead, the next sonogram shows the clock in my head (linear amplitude)
under 1733 Hz, demodulated, under-sampled and recorded to a sound file:

![](media/945mhz_clock.jpg)

There are two types of pulse:

-   Pulses with sinusoids separated by 180 Hz, bandwidth of 3960 Hz and pulse frequency of 21 Hz.

-   Pulses with sinusoids separated by 180 Hz and variable pulse repetition period.

### Method to get the voices from the audio recording

-   FIR filter to select the content between 6 and 9 kHz.

-   Pitch 1 octave up (optional).

    ```
    # example
    rubberband -f2 in.wav out.wav
    ```

-   Slope detector.

    ```
    pseudo-code: env_follower(diff(input))
    ```

-   BP filter to select the content between 100Hz and 3.5kHz.

[cuba_attack_decoded.ogg](https://github.com/titola/neuropa/blob/master/media/cuba_attack_decoded.ogg)

Alternative method:

-   FIR filter to select the content between 6 and 9 kHz.

-   Convolution of a set of impulses with a FIR BP, fmin=100Hz and fmax=3kHz.

    ```
    # pseudo-code to generate the set of impulses

    d[n] = in[n] - in[n-1]
    if d[n] < 0 and d[n-1] >= 0
        then out[n] = in[n-1]
        else out[n] = 0
    endif
    ```

Other signals to analyse
------------------------

This type of signal is synchronized with the voices:

![](media/461mhz.jpg)

Received at the frequencies 173.456 MHz, 173.880 MHz, 173.956 MHz and
460.557 MHz with bandwidth of 4 kHz.

A sinusoidal signal goes down from the maximum to the central
frequency and continues with duration between 0.072 and 0.076 seconds,
then it is amplitude modulated by a sinusoid of 2 kHz (mix of two side
sinusoids) for 0.034 seconds. The middle part is a kind of noise with
LTAS (Long-Term Average Spectrum) almost uniform in bandwidth:

![](media/422_733_ltas.jpg)

The duration of the final sinusoidal signal is about 0.034 seconds.

The duration of the noisy part (maybe a cloud of sinusoidal gains)
depends on the perceived voice.

The following signal is similar but with duration of 0.178 seconds,
constant period of 1.92 seconds

```
# quantized to 20.83 Hz
1.92 = 0.048 * 40
```

and without isolated sinusoidal signals:

![](media/422_733mhz.jpg)

Received at the frequencies 421.684 MHz (bw 5kHz instead of 4kHz) and
422.733 MHz (bw 3kHz instead of 4kHz).
